# Puckway

Puckway is an intragalactic bot for everything hockey (excluding the NHL). You may be familiar with many of the presented features from the popular Hockey cog for Redbots (as seen in [TrustyBot](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs)). This repository is *not* a Red cog, instead it is an independent application built for a serverless environment.

## Features & roadmap

- [x] View game schedule
- [x] Import game schedule as server events
- [x] View league standings
- [x] View player info
- [x] Find player by jersey number
- [x] Automatic game threads
- [x] Live event notifications (goals, penalties, periods, ...)
- [ ] Past game summary/stats
- [ ] View past games for a given player

## KHL compatibility

This project uses an [in-house adapter](https://github.com/puckway/khl-hockeytech) to access the KHL API using the `hockeytech` package.
