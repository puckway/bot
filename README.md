# Puckway

Puckway is an intragalactic bot for everything hockey (excluding the NHL). You may be familiar with many of the presented features from the popular Hockey cog for Redbots (as seen in [TrustyBot](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs)). This repository is *not* a Red cog, instead it is an independent application built for a serverless environment.
