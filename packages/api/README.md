# khl-bot/api

This package contains much of my own reverse engineering work on the KHL's internal API(s), especially the mobile app (thank you [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com)!). I plan to write generic, comprehensive documentation in the future (Ã  la [dword4/nhlapi](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi)), but for now you may glean from this package to your needs; I aim to document types extensively but I do not always use all available parameters in a request. Feel free to contact me if you have any relevant questions.
