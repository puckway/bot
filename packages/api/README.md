# puckway/api

This package contains much of my own reverse engineering work on the KHL's internal API(s), especially the mobile app (thank you [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com)!). For API documentation & types, check out [khl-api](https://github.com/shayypy/khl-api).

## Warning

This package is no longer used by the `bot` package, so it may be removed in the future. It was replaced by [khl-hockeytech](https://github.com/puckway/khl-hockeytech), a proxy to make the KHL API compatible with existing Hockeytech code.
